object DelayedInit {

  // The special handling of the DelayedInit trait is no longer supported.

  // One consequence is that the App class, which used DelayedInit is now partially broken.
  // You can still use App for an easy and concise way to set up a main program. Example:

  object HelloWorld extends App {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }

  // However, the code is now run in the initializer of the object, which on some JVM's means
  // that it will only be interpreted. So, better not use it for benchmarking!
  // Also, if you want to access the command line arguments, you need to use an explicit main method for that.

  object Hello {
    def main(args: Array[String]) =
      println(s"Hello, ${args(0)}")
  }
}
